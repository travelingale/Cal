DESCRIPTION:Last week's storm spinning in the southwest Pacific had impres
 sive 50+ knot winds and 40'+ seas. A lot of the resultant swell was lost t
 o decay\, resulting in surf that will mainly be running in the waist-chest
  high range\, while standouts go head-high on occasion. The long travel di
 stance and mediocre storm track mean this swell will be a lully one. A lit
 tle NW swell lingers.<br>\n<br>\nLight S/SSW AM winds\, puff up to light+ 
 onshores for the afternoon. Early afternoon high tide slows many spots.
