 Easing shot of mid-period WNW swell\, as some smaller SSW swell hangs on\,
  for head high to 1-2' overhead range surf at good breaks in the morning a
 s the high tide drops out. Slow fade due during the back half of the day b
 ut the low tide helps keep the surf fun.  \n\nLight/variable winds expecte

 ading blend of primary WNW swell and smaller SSW swell shows most size in 
 the morning for waist to chest+ high waves at better breaks. Surf tapers o
 ff during the day. \n\nAt this point\, light/variable wind  expected throu
 gh the day. Mid-morning high tide slows the smaller surf.

DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.888ft at 13:00\n-0.031ft at 15:42\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 Old blend of WNW swell and SSW swell with mainly thigh to stomach high sur
 f in the morning. New\, mid-period WNW swell scheduled to kick up more siz
 e during the afternoon\, for widespread head high to 1-2' overhead surf\, 
 showing largest late. \n\nLight+ WSW winds due most of the day for fair to
  decent conditions. Mid-morning high tide bogs down the smaller surf.

DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.934ft at 13:30\n-0.007ft at 16:18\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 Strong blend of WNW swell\, along with some longer-period SSW swell\, sche
 duled to max out in the morning\, setting up overhead to double overhead r
 ange waves at good spots. Surf dips a bit PM. \n\nWind is the question rig
 ht now and it'll depend on the track/orientation of another coastal low th
 rough the back half of the week. Right now the outlook is favorable for mu
 ch of the day.\n\nWe'll refine over the coming days -- stay tuned.
