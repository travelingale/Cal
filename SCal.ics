DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.956ft at 11:30\n-2.996ft at 17:00\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 Conditions will be favorable to open November and both the WNW and SW swel
 l will have a good deal of west in them\, so nice directions for the Santa
  Cruz region.\n\nLook for widespread head high surf off the swell mix\, wi
 th top breaks a couple to a few feet overhead\, showing most size back hal
 f of the day. Good shape and conditions with some bowled up corners off th
 e swell mix.\n\nHigh pressure maintains pleasant/warm weather and light wi
 nd. Early AM high tide slows many spots.

DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.912ft at 10:54\n-2.802ft at 17:06\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 Healthy blend of mid-period WNW swell and longer-period Southern Hemi\, ea
 ch with a nice share of favorable west in them\, will have lots of spots r
 unning in the head high to 1-2' overhead zone\, as better exposures are se
 veral feet+ overhead and top breaks are double overhead+. Good shape and c
 onditions with some bowled up corners off the swell combo.\n\nLight/variab
 le winds keep conditions clean through the day.

DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.905ft at 11:24\n-1.508ft at 17:06\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 Off a notch from Sunday\, but an easing blend of WNW and SW swell is still
  good for widespread head high to 1-2' overhead waves at many spots in the
  morning\, while better breaks are easily overhead. Surf gradually tapers 
 off during the afternoon. \n\nMorning starts off clean with light/variable
  winds. SW onshores puff up to light+ for the afternoon.
