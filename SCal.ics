DESCRIPTION:Nice shot of SSW/S swell peaks\, as shorter-period NW swell jo
 ins in\, setting up more chest to shoulder high+ surf at southerly exposed
  spots\, as focal points hit head high to 1-2' overhead on  favorable mid 
 afternoon lower tide. <br>\n<br>\nWinds shift to light+ SW for the afterno
 on and generally clean in town.

 es. <br>\n<br>\nLight/variable wind through the day for glassy to clean co

 close second.

DESCRIPTION:Fading SSW swell and secondary NW swell is still good for wais
 t to shoulder high surf at good spots in the morning\, as top breaks hit h
 ead high. Slow fade during the day. <br>\n<br>\nAt this point it looks lik
