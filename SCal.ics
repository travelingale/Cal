DESCRIPTION:Long-period\, steep-angled S swell tops out\, putting well exp
 osed spots in chest to shoulder high surf\, as best breaks see sets going 
 1-2' overhead. Not far off from the surf over the 4th-5th. Take advantage 
 of the early tide push -- best shape\, cleanest conditions then.<br>\n<br>
 \nLight S winds due through the morning\, shift/rise to low-end moderate S
 SW afternoon onshores for a little bump in town. Deeper tides will be the 
 bigger headache for the back half of the day\, especially the evening.
