DTSTART:20260121T143000
DTEND:20260121T171200
DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.903ft at 14:30\n-0.045ft at 17:12\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 W/WNW swell tops out early morning\, with widespread chest-head+ surf in t
 he water as better spots go a foot+ overhead. Shape will be decent on the 
 moderate tide in the morning\, getting more sluggish into midday as the ti
 de peaks.\n\nLight/variable wind and glassy conditions for the morning win
 dow. The afternoon stays pretty clean too\, but spots without headland/kel
 p protection can expect a little bit of onshore seabreeze crumble.

DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.433ft at 07:18\n-2.972ft at 08:24\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 W/WNW swell is down to fun/mid-sized levels. Waist-chest high surf for bet
 ter spots\, standouts head-high before the tide gets too deep in the later
  morning. \n\nLighter/variable wind due for the AM window at this point fo
 r clean conditions in town. The afternoon looks decent\, but openly expose
 d zones can expect some texture as light+ SW wind wraps into town.

DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.032ft at 07:18\n-2.999ft at 10:00\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 Decent size combo of old and new WNW swell keeps waves running thigh to st
 omach high in the morning\, then the surf edges up in the afternoon as mor
 e swell gradually moves in. \n\nLight/variable morning winds shift to a li
 ght sea breeze in the afternoon for clean to textured conditions. Moderate
  high tide mid day bogs down tide sensitive spots.
