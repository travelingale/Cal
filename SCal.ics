DTEND:20251105T143000
DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.852ft at 12:42\n-0.099ft at 14:30\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 Trend towards smaller waves continues early as old WNW and SW swell blend 
 dips\, for mainly waist to shoulder high+ waves. Fresh\, lower-period WSW 
 swell builds in through the day\, setting up head high to overhead surf\, 
 showing largest late. \n\nLight+ SSE winds in the early morning for some l
 ump\, then the onshores shift SSW and rise to moderate+ mid-day into the a
 fternoon for bumpier conditions.

DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.922ft at 13:24\n-0.045ft at 15:12\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 A deepening low currently tracking eastward under the Aleutians is expecte
 d to push in a peaking round of mid to longer-period WNW swell with a bit 
 more west than we've seen so far.  \n\nThat little extra west and favorabl
 e period could mean the strongest NPAC surf of the young season at many sp
 ots\, with potentially double to triple overhead range surf as the swell p
 eaks in the afternoon.\n\nAM winds look light\, but there's a deep mid-AM 
 high tide to be aware of. Light sea breeze in the PM.

DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.927ft at 14:12\n-0.096ft at 16:00\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 Easing WNW swell is still good for overhead to double overhead surf in the
  early morning\, then waves taper off during the day. \n\nLight winds due 
 all day. Deep mid-AM high tide slows most spots.

DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.866ft at 15:06\n-0.101ft at 17:00\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 Mix of old and new WNW swell has waves running chest to head high at good 
 spots\, while top breaks see overhead sets. \n\nLight/variable to light of
 fshores due through the day\, for nice conditions. Mind the deep mid-day h
 igh tide.
