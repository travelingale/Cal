DESCRIPTION:Easing blend of SSW and NW swell\, for waves averaging around 
 waist high. <br>\n<br>\nPattern of light/variable morning winds for a clea
 n first half of the day. NW winds picking up in the afternoon could keep c
 onditions in town clean for the back half of the day. That said\, the morn
 ing tide window is much better to hit\, especially given the smaller surf 
 on tap.
