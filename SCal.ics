DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.981ft at 13:54\n-0.063ft at 16:18\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 New W swell builds through the day\, fun in the morning\, trending mid-siz
 ed\, shoulder to a foot+ overhead through the back half of the day at good
  spots. With the draining tide through the afternoon\, there will be some 
 properly squared-up sets coming through.\n\nHigh pressure is weakening thr
 ough the middle of the week\, but morning light offshores persist. Light s

DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.903ft at 14:30\n-0.045ft at 17:12\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 W/WNW swell tops out early morning\, with widespread chest-head+ surf in t
 he water as better spots go overhead+. Shape should be decent on the moder
 ate tide in the morning\, getting sluggish into midday as it peaks.\n\nLig
 ht/variable wind and glassy conditions for the morning window. The afterno
 on looks pretty clean too\, but spots without headland/kelp protection can
  expect a little bit of onshore seabreeze crumble.

DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.433ft at 07:18\n-2.972ft at 08:24\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 W/WNW swell is down to fun/mid-sized leftovers. Waist-chest high surf expe
 cted for better spots\, standouts head-high before the tide gets too deep 
 in the morning. \n\nLighter/variable wind due for the AM window at this po
 int for clean conditions in town. The afternoon looks decent\, but openly 
 exposed zones can expect some texture as SW wind wraps into town.

DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.032ft at 07:18\n-2.999ft at 10:00\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 Decent size combo of old and new WNW swell keeps waves running waist to ch
 est high in the morning\, then the surf edges up in the afternoon as more 
 swell gradually moves in. \n\nLight/variable morning winds shift to a ligh
 t sea breeze in the afternoon for a clean to textured conditions. Moderate
  high tide mid day bogs down tide sensitive spots.
