SUMMARY:Surf's Up
DTSTART:20251106T132400
DTEND:20251106T151200
DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.922ft at 13:24\n-0.045ft at 15:12\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 A good looking low that's been tracking eastward well under the Alaskan Gu
 lf recently pushed down a healthy mid to longer-period W/WNW swell with a 
 bit more west than we've seen so far.  \n\nThe swell's extra west and favo
 rable period makes it the strongest NPAC surf of the young season at many 
 spots\, with double to triple overhead range surf for good breaks as the s
 well peaks in the PM.\n\nLight winds all day\, some leftover lump due earl
 y AM. Deep high tide mid-morning slows some spots.

DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.927ft at 14:12\n-0.096ft at 16:00\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 Easing WNW swell is still good for overhead to double overhead range surf 
 in the early morning\, then waves taper off during the day. \n\nLight wind
 s due all day. Deep mid-AM high tide slows most spots.

DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.866ft at 15:06\n-0.101ft at 17:00\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 Mix of old and new WNW swell has waves running chest to head high at good 
 spots\, while top breaks see overhead sets. \n\nLight/variable to light of
 fshores due through the day\, for nice conditions. Mind the deep mid-day h
 igh tide.

 g\, then waves taper off during the day. \n\nLight winds/nice conditions e
 xpected all day. Mid-day high tide bogs down the smaller surf.
