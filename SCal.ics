DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.979ft at 08:24\n-0.023ft at 11:54\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 Combo of WNW swell and well secondary SSW swell is good for widespread wai
 st to chest high waves in the morning. Top breaks hit head high. Surf slow
 ly tapers off as swell eases during the afternoon. \n\nLight/variable wind
 s much of the morning\, followed by a light+ SW afternoon sea breeze.

DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.885ft at 09:24\n-0.059ft at 11:48\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 Combo of modest\, shorter to mid period swell size and a full tide means t
 he early session will be on the soft and slow side. Surf improves for the 
 afternoon as new\, mid to longer period WNW swell builds and the tide will
  be low/incoming. Head high to overhead sets develop through the second ha
 lf of the day.

DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.871ft at 10:18\n-0.083ft at 12:18\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 Healthy shot of mid-period WNW swell tops out\, along with well secondary 
 (but decent/fun) \, longer-period SW Southern Hemi. Dawn patrol will be sl
 owed somewhat by 6' high tide. Ebbing tide sees widespread overhead to wel
 l overhead surf. Top spots up to 2-2.5x overhead\, potentially larger. \n\
 nWinds looking light through the day\, offshore in the morning\, turning v
 ariable for the afternoon.

 Slow fading combo of WNW swell and well secondary (but decent/fun) SW swel
 l is down a couple notches from a likely peak Thursday afternoon\, but the
  surf is still pumping (especially during the first half of the day).  \n\
 nDeep high tide around dawn slows things slightly but as it drops the surf
  will stand up through the morning
