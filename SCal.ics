DTEND:20240918T081800

SUMMARY:1 - 2ft: Poor to fair
DTSTART:20240919T070000
DTEND:20240919T083600
DESCRIPTION:Favorable conditions in the morning and a nice tide push...but
  the surf is still small. NW swell is up but too steep and low period to g
 et significant energy into town. SW swell leftovers kinda help the cause. 
 Keep the big board handy.

DESCRIPTION:Another clean morning with a favorable tide push but the surf 
 is smaller than Thursday. Have a big board ready to get what's left of the
  SW swell and avoid the midday high tide that'll leave most spots flat.
