DTSTART:20260110T074800
DTEND:20260110T170600
DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.957ft at 07:48\n-2.938ft at 17:06\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 Fading WNW swell\, along with a secondary SW pulse\, for waist to shoulder
 + surf in the morning\, easing in the afternoon. Morning window looks best
 . The higher tide and weakening swell in the afternoon will slow down the 
 surf quite a bit.\n\nAM conditions similar to Fri with light/variable to l
 ight offshore wind. Afternoon seabreeze crumble creeps back in.

DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.987ft at 08:30\n-2.714ft at 17:06\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 Old WNW leftovers offer up some cruisy lines for the bigger boards in the 
 morning. New long period WNW swell picks up in the afternoon\, trending fu
 n-zone and punchy by the end of the day.\n\nWind looks light all day\, cle
 an in the morning with some onshore crumble likely in the afternon at spot
 s without any headland or kelp protection.

DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.977ft at 09:12\n-2.3ft at 17:12\n\nOBSERVATION:\nLa
 rge W/WNW swell tops out after an overnight build. Raw swell not as big as
  the more recent NW pulse\, but the more westerly direction means iust as 
 much size gets into Santa Cruz -- if not a little more\, especially at the
  tucked-away zones further in town. Sets at top zones likely still going d
 ouble overhead+.\n\nSimilar situation for winds. Light/variable to light o
 ffshore in the morning with a light seabreeze adding some texture in the a
 fternoon.

DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.93ft at 09:54\n-1.714ft at 17:12\n\nOBSERVATION:\nS
 till solid for the best exposed breaks as WNW swell slowly winds down. Rel
 atively soft on the high tide first thing\, standing up as it drops with h
 ead-high to overhead waves on offer -- in the well-overhead to double over
 head zone for top spots. Afternoon tide push is a good alternative\, and a
  little smaller if the morning window is too big for you.\n\nConditions in
  town look clean all day with light/variable to light northerly wind -- li
 ght onshore seabreeze possible in the afternoon.
