DTSTART:20251203T113600
DTEND:20251203T132400
DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.938ft at 11:36\n-0.111ft at 13:24\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 Easing long-period WNW swell is still good for head high+ to several feet 
 overhead surf in the morning. The dawn patrol will be slowed by a near 6.5
 ' high tide. Wave size gradually tapers off during the day. \n\nWinds are 
 light and mainly offshore all day for nice conditions.

DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.828ft at 12:24\n-0.109ft at 14:00\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 Smaller WNW swell leftovers are still good for waves in the waist-shoulder
 -head high range in the morning\, squashed by the tide. Even with the swel
 l easing\, the dropping tide should have many spots looking better/bigger 
 than they do first thing -- still topping out around chest-high with stand
 outs head-high. \n\nThe late AM to early PM window looks like the one to t
 arget\, but PM onshores look mellow if you can't get in the water until la
 ter in the day -- it'll just be draining out quickly.

DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.975ft at 13:06\n-0.034ft at 14:48\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 WNW swell leftovers are down into the knee-waist high range for better spo
 ts in town\, but most breaks are likely smaller through the morning due to
  the 6.5'+ high tide.\n\nWind looks like it'll stay light for the tide dro
 p through midday. Will probably want to hit it before the evening window t
 hough -- negative low tide makes for a drained and dumpy end to the day.

DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.984ft at 13:54\n-0.129ft at 15:36\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 New round of mid-period WNW fills in through the day\, showing most size o
 ver the afternoon with widespread waist to head high surf and better sets 
 at standouts. \n\nLight winds due all day. Mid-morning bogged down by a 6.
 5' high tide. Negative low tide makes for a drained and dumpy end to the d
 ay.
