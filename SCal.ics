DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.582ft at 07:12\n-2.996ft at 07:36\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 Little more WNW swell due to join a lingering NW and SSW swell mix\, setti
 ng up waist-stomach-chest high waves at the better breaks. \n\nThe tide is
  quite high late morning/mid day\, which is going to swamp the modest swel
 l mix. \n\nLight/variable morning winds\, due to be followed by a light+ S
 W sea breeze.

 Modest scale combo of WNW/NW swell holds for mainly thigh to stomach high+
  surf. Top combo spots see lingering chest high sets on the better tides (
 earlier to mid AM and later PM). \n\nLight/variable morning winds\, due to
  be followed by a light+ SW-W afternoon sea breeze.
