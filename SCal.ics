DTSTART:20251204T122400
DTEND:20251204T140000
DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.828ft at 12:24\n-0.109ft at 14:00\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 Smaller WNW swell is still good for waves in the waist-shoulder-head high 
 range in the morning\, squashed by the deep tide. Even with the swell easi
 ng\, the dropping tide will have many spots looking better/bigger than the
 y do first thing -- still topping out around chest-high with standouts hea
 d-high. Waves ease as the day goes on\n\nThe late AM to early PM window is
  the one to target\, but PM onshores are light if you can't get in the wat
 er until later in the day\, it'll just be draining out quickly

DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.975ft at 13:06\n-0.034ft at 14:48\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 WNW swell leftovers are down into the knee-waist high range for better spo
 ts in town\, but most breaks are likely smaller through the morning due to
  the 6.5'+ high tide.\n\nWind looks like it'll stay light for the tide dro
 p through midday. Will probably want to hit it before the evening window t
 hough -- negative low tide makes for a drained and dumpy end to the day.

 New round of mid-period WNW fills in through the day\, showing most size o
 ver the afternoon with widespread waist to shoulder high surf and better s
 ets at standouts\, most size late. \n\nLight winds due all day. Mid-mornin
 g bogged down by a 6.5' high tide. Negative low tide makes for a drained a
 nd dumpy end to the day.

 Mid-period WNW swell tops out early morning\, for waves running chest to h
 ead high at good breaks\, then surf tapers off during the day. Mid-day slo
 wed by a 6'+ high tide. Negative low tide makes for a drained and dumpy en
 d to the day.\n\nWinds are light all day\, offshore in the morning\, S sea
  breeze for the afternoon.
