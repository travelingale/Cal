DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.989ft at 12:42\n-2.986ft at 15:18TIDES:\nNice shot 
 of SSW/S swell peaks\, as shorter-period NW swell joins in\, setting up mo
 re chest to shoulder high+ surf at southerly exposed spots\, as focal poin
 ts hit head high to 1-2' overhead on  favorable mid afternoon lower tide. 
 <br>\n<br>\nWinds shift to light+ SW for the afternoon and generally clean
  in town.

  when the tides are favorable. <br>\n<br>\nLight/variable winds most of th
 e morning\, puff up to a light+ SW sea breeze in the afternoon. <br>\n<br>
 \nBest wind/tide window for most spots will be the dawn patrol. Later afte
