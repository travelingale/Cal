DTSTART:20260119T132400
DTEND:20260119T153600
DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.931ft at 13:24\n-0.095ft at 15:36\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 Swell period backs off from Sunday\, so size/push probably backs off a lit
 tle bit -- especially around the high tide mid-morning. Chest-head high su
 rf on tap\, maybe a touch overhead for focal points once the tide backs ou
 t midday/early afternoon.\n\nClean conditions with light northerly wind fo
 r the morning window. Afternoon seabreeze likely adds a little texture to 
 open exposures -- headland/kelp protected breaks clean all day.

DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.981ft at 13:54\n-0.063ft at 16:18\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 New W swell builds through the day\, fun in the morning\, trending mid-siz
 ed through the back half of the day. With the draining tide through the af
 ternoon\, there should be some properly squared-up sets coming through.\n\
 nHigh pressure is likely weakening through the middle of the week\, but we
 're still expecting offshores at this point\, at least for the morning win
 dow.

DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.903ft at 14:30\n-0.045ft at 17:12\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 W/WNW swell sticks around with chest-head surf likely in the water as bett
 er spots go overhead+. Shape should be decent on the moderate tide in the 
 morning\, getting sluggish into midday as it peaks.\n\nLight/variable wind
  and glassy conditions for the morning window. The afternoon looks pretty 
 clean too\, but spots without headland/kelp protection can expect a little
  bit of onshore seabreeze crumble.

DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.433ft at 07:18\n-2.972ft at 08:24\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 W/WNW swell is down to fun/mid-sized leftovers. Waist-chest high surf expe
 cted for better spots\, standouts head-high before the tide gets too deep 
 in the morning. \n\nLighter/variable wind due for the AM window at this po
 int for clean conditions in town. The afternoon looks decent\, but openly 
 exposed zones can expect some texture as SW wind wraps into town.
