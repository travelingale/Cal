DTSTART:20251103T112400
DTEND:20251103T170600
DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.905ft at 11:24\n-1.508ft at 17:06\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 Off a notch from yesterday\, but an easing blend of WNW and SW swell is st
 ill good for widespread head high to 1-2' overhead waves at many spots in 
 the morning\, while better breaks are easily overhead. Surf gradually tape
 rs off during the afternoon. \n\nMorning starts off foggy and clean with l
 ight/variable winds. SW onshores puff up to light+ for the afternoon. Earl
 y morning deep high tide slows tide sensitive spots.

DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.897ft at 12:00\n-0.003ft at 14:12\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 Slowly fading combo of WNW and SW swell shows most size in the morning\, w
 ith shoulder to head high surf for many spots\, as better breaks are going
  overhead. Gradual fade as the day goes on. \n\nLight/variable winds in th
 e morning\, shift light+ SW for the afternoon.  Early morning deep high ti
 de slows tide sensitive spots.

DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.852ft at 12:42\n-0.099ft at 14:30\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 Trend towards smaller waves continues early as old WNW and SW swell blend 
 dips\, for mainly waist to shoulder high+ waves. Fresh\, mid to longer-per
 iod W swell builds in the afternoon\, setting up head high to overhead sur
 f\, showing largest late. \n\nLooking like breezy S onshores winds through
  the day for sloppy conditions. Stay tuned.

DESCRIPTION:TIDES:\n-2.922ft at 13:24\n-0.045ft at 15:12\n\nOBSERVATION:\n
 A deepening low currently tracking eastward under the Aleutians is expecte
 d to push in a peaking round of mid to longer-period WNW swell with a bit 
 more west than we've seen so far.  \n\nThat little extra west and favorabl
 e period could mean the strongest NPAC surf of the young season at many sp
 ots\, with potentially double to triple overhead range surf as the swell p
 eaks in the afternoon.\n\nAM winds look light\, but there's a deep mid-AM 
 high tide to be aware of.
